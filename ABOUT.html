         <div class="content"><h2>Koenigsegg moved to its present location and headquarters<br>
in Ängelholm, Sweden, in 2003<br>. The building had previously
been home to the Swedish Air Force<br> and once housed JAS
39 Gripen fighter jets.<br>

Now refurbished to suit Koenigsegg’s requirements, these<br>
facilities provide the perfect infrastructure for building<br>
high-tech Hypercars. There is ample room for the<br>
composite workshop, engine development and testing, <br>a
pre- and final assembly hall, a paint shop, research and<br>
development facilities, as well as vehicle and parts storage.<br>

It is here, in this state-of-the-art facility in southern Sweden,<br>
that Koenigsegg creates a handful of bespoke Hypercars<br>
every year.</h2>
